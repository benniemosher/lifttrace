# Public REST API

A versioned REST API at `/api/v1`, for scripts and automations that want
plain JSON over HTTP rather than the [Model Context Protocol](https://traceapps.github.io/docs/lifttrace/mcp/)
LiftTrace also speaks. Off by default. Pull-based, if you want to be
notified the instant something happens instead of polling, see
[outgoing webhooks](webhooks.md).

## Enabling it

Set these in your server environment (see `DEPLOY.md`):

```
PUBLIC_API_ENABLED=1        # turns on the read routes below
PUBLIC_API_WRITE_ENABLED=1  # optional, turns on the write routes too
```

## Authentication

Same personal access tokens as MCP: create one in Settings, API Tokens
(admin, multi-user mode only, a token needs a real account to own it).
Send it as a bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer lt_pat_...
```

A token's scopes govern both MCP tools and this API the same way: a
token with `mcp:read` can read via either interface, `mcp:write` unlocks
the write routes on either interface too. There is no separate REST-only
scope to create.

## Rate limiting

Each token is limited to 60 requests per minute by default (`API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`
to change it). Responses carry `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`,
and `X-RateLimit-Reset`; a `429` response also carries `Retry-After`.

## Errors

A bad request (an invalid date, an exercise name with no match) returns
`400` with `{"error": "..."}`. A missing or invalid token returns `401`;
a token lacking the required scope returns `403`.

## Endpoints

### Read (require `mcp:read`)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/workouts?start=&end=&limit=` | Every session in an inclusive date range, in the same full detail as the single-day route, plus `session_seq` for days with more than one session. With both bounds omitted the range is the last 90 days; giving one bound leaves the other open. Returns the most recent 30 sessions by default (max 100); `truncated` and `total` say when more matched. |
| GET | `/api/v1/workouts/:date` | One day's workout, every exercise and set. Timed sets (planks, holds, carries) carry `duration_sec` in seconds, and each exercise its `set_type`. `date` defaults to today. |
| GET | `/api/v1/workouts/recent?limit=&start=&end=` | Recent workouts, most recent first, as a summary rather than full set detail. `limit` defaults to 10, max 50. Optional inclusive `start`/`end` bounds narrow the history it draws from. |
| GET | `/api/v1/records?exercise_name=&start=&end=` | Personal records per exercise: max weight, reps at that weight, date, estimated 1-rep max. Timed exercises (planks, holds, carries) report `maxDuration` (longest hold, in seconds), `maxDurationWeight` and `durationDate` instead. `exercise_name` optionally filters by a case-insensitive substring. With `start`/`end` these are the best lifts within those dates, not all-time records. |
| GET | `/api/v1/exercises/:name/progress?start=&end=` | Per-session progress for one exercise (max weight, longest hold as `max_duration_sec`, volume, set count, average RPE) over a date range. `:name` is matched case-insensitively by substring; an ambiguous match returns `{ambiguous: true, candidates: [...]}` instead of guessing. Range defaults to the last 90 days. |
| GET | `/api/v1/exercises?query=&limit=` | Search the exercise catalog by name. Each match includes `set_type`: `"time"` means sets are logged by duration. `limit` defaults to 10, max 25. |
| GET | `/api/v1/programs` | List your programs, owned or coach-assigned. |
| GET | `/api/v1/programs/active` | The currently active program: current week and every weekly template. |
| GET | `/api/v1/body-stats/:date` | Body-stat measurements (weight, body fat, tape measurements) for a date. |
| GET | `/api/v1/body-stats?start=&end=` | The same measurements for every logged date in an inclusive range. Both bounds omitted means the last 90 days; one bound leaves the other open. Dates with nothing logged are absent. |
| GET | `/api/v1/body-stats/photos?start=&end=` | Progress photos with their dates, newest first. Range defaults to the last year. Each photo has a `file_url` to fetch its image with the same token. |
| GET | `/api/v1/body-stats/photos/:id/file` | The image itself, for a photo you own. Returns 409 for a photo attached by external URL, which has no local file. |
| GET | `/api/v1/cardio?start=&end=&activity=` | Cardio sessions (runs, rides, rows, walks, swims) in an inclusive date range, oldest first. Both bounds omitted means the last 90 days; one bound leaves the other open. `activity` is an optional case-insensitive substring, so `run` matches `Running` and `Trail run`. Each session includes the `external_id` it was logged with, if any, and the response's `cardio_enabled` says whether the user has cardio turned on. |

### Write (require `mcp:write` and `PUBLIC_API_WRITE_ENABLED=1`)

| Method | Path | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/workouts/:date/sets` | `{exercise_id, reps, weight?, rpe?, warmup?, completed?}` or `{exercise_id, duration_sec, weight?, ...}` | Appends one set to an exercise on that day, creating the exercise entry if it isn't logged yet. `exercise_id` comes from the exercises search endpoint. For a timed exercise (plank, wall sit, dead hang, carry) send `duration_sec` in whole seconds instead of `reps`; `weight` then means a weighted hold. An exercise already logged by reps that day rejects `duration_sec`, and the reverse, rather than mixing the two. |
| PUT | `/api/v1/body-stats/:date` | `{weight?, weight_unit?, bodyFat?, waist?, hips?, neck?, chest?, biceps?, thighs?, calves?}` | Merges the given values into that day's stats; omitted fields are left alone. `weight_unit: "lb"` converts to kg before storing. |
| POST | `/api/v1/body-stats/photos` | `{url, date?}` | Attaches an already-hosted image to a date as a progress photo. `date` defaults to today. |
| POST | `/api/v1/cardio` | `{activity, duration_min, distance?, distance_unit?, avg_hr?, notes?, date?, external_id?}` | Logs one cardio session. `duration_min` is whole minutes; `distance` is in km unless `distance_unit` is `mi`. `date` defaults to today. Refused with a 400 while the user has cardio turned off in Settings, the same opt-in the app uses. Pass `external_id`, your own id for the session (up to 200 characters), to make the call safe to repeat: if that user already logged a session with the id, it comes back unchanged with `created: false` instead of a second copy. |

`POST /api/v1/body-stats/photos` takes a URL, not a file: nothing in this
API handles multipart uploads. Point it at an image you already host, or
upload through the app, which posts to its own session-authenticated
upload route first and then calls this with the URL that returns.

Not yet exposed here: deleting a workout. That stays MCP-only for now
(see `delete_workout` in the MCP setup guide), since it is an
irreversible hard delete and this surface hasn't needed that capability
yet.
